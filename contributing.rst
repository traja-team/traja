Contributing to Traja
=====================

Traja is a research library. Functionality must therefore be both
cutting-edge and reliable. Traja is part of a wider project to
increase collaboration in research, through the adoption of
open-source contribution models. It is our hope that traja
remains accessible to researchers and help them do higher-quality
research.

Current status
--------------

Traja is currently undergoing active development with approximately
60 % of features present. Significant interface changes are still
possible, however we avoid these unless absolutely necessary.

The work is currently focussed on reaching version 1.0 with feature
completeness and 95 % test coverage.

The following features are required for feature completeness:

* Latent space visualisers
   * Eigenspace-based
   * Colour-coded to visualise evolution over time
   * Delay coordinate embeddings
* State-space visualisers
* Additional encoder and decoder options in AE and VAE models
   * MLP
   * 1d convolution
* Pituitary gland example dataset
* Regression output visualisers
* VAE GAN models
* Additional VAE latent-space shapes
   * Uniform
   * A shape that works for periodic trajectories (Torus?)
* Delay coordinate embeddings
   * Persistent homology diagrams of the embeddings
* Automatic code formatter
* Tutorials
   * Find time of day based on activity
   * `Recover parameters from Pituitary ODE <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Fc8Z6LtjMBk20QPPzJt8uDAxWu5dz_1Y?usp=sharing>`_
   * `Predict stock prices with LSTMs <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TAW9Lv0Sm9g8YRgYXaiHIZBqnGtGQn1H?usp=sharing>`_

How to contribute
-----------------

Traja welcomes contributions! To get started, pick up any issue
labeled with `good first issue`! Alternatively you can read some
background material or try a tutorial.

Testing and code quality
------------------------

Since Traja is a library, we strive for sensible tests achieving a
high level of code coverage. Future commits are required to maintain
or improve code quality, test coverage. To aid in this, Travis runs
automated tests on each pull request. Additionally, we run codecov
on PRs.
