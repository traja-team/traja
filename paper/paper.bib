Preclinical testing of neuroprotective drugs is an important aspect of assessing their therapeutic potential, but guidelines concerning how to perform preclinical development of purported neuroprotective drugs for acute ischemic stroke are lacking. This conference of academicians and industry representatives was convened to suggest such guidelines for the preclinical evaluation of neuroprotective drugs and to recommend to potential clinical investigators the data they should review to reassure themselves that a particular neuroprotective drug has a reasonable chance to succeed in an appropriately designed clinical trial. Without rigorous, robust, and detailed preclinical evaluation, it is unlikely that novel neuroprotective drugs will prove to be effective when tested in large, time-consuming, and expensive clinical trials. Additionally, similar recommendations are provided for drugs with the potential to enhance recovery after acute ischemic stroke, a burgeoning new field with great potential but little currently available data. The suggestions contained in this document are meant to serve as overall guidelines that must be adapted to the individual characteristics related to particular drugs and their preclinical and clinical development needs.},

Although recognized as reasonable, they have not been closely followed nor rigorously validated. Substantial advances have occurred regarding the appropriate quality and breadth of preclinical testing for candidate acute stroke therapies for better clinical translation. The updated STAIR preclinical recommendations reinforce the previous suggestions that reproducibly defining dose response and time windows with both histological and functional outcomes in multiple animal species with appropriate physiological monitoring is appropriate. The updated STAIR recommendations include: the fundamentals of good scientific inquiry should be followed by eliminating randomization and assessment bias, a priori defining inclusion/exclusion criteria, performing appropriate power and sample size calculations, and disclosing potential conflicts of interest. After initial evaluations in young, healthy male animals, further studies should be performed in females, aged animals, and animals with comorbid conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. Another consideration is the use of clinically relevant biomarkers in animal studies. Although the recommendations cannot be validated until effective therapies based on them emerge from clinical trials, it is hoped that adherence to them might enhance the chances for success.},

In addition, we model horizon-based interactions which are used to implicitly model the driving behavior of each road-agent.

The spatio-temporal dynamics of these parameters were studied in relation to blood flow changes. Micro positron emission tomography (μPET) using [18F]BR-351 showed MMP activity within the first days after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAo), followed by increased [18F]DPA-714 uptake as a marker for microglia activation with a maximum at 14 days after tMCAo. The inflammatory response was spatially located in the infarct core and in adjacent (penumbral) tissue. For the first time, multimodal imaging based on PET, single photon emission computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed insight into the spatio-temporal distribution of critical parameters of poststroke inflammation.

Mimicking all aspects of human stroke in one animal model is not feasible because ischemic stroke in humans is a heterogeneous disorder with a complex pathophysiology. The transient or permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) model is one of the models that most closely simulate human ischemic stroke. Furthermore, this model is characterized by reliable and well-reproducible infarcts. Therefore, the MCAo model has been involved in the majority of studies that address pathophysiological processes or neuroprotective agents. Another model uses thromboembolic clots and thus is more convenient for investigating thrombolytic agents and pathophysiological processes after thrombolysis. However, for many reasons, preclinical stroke research has a low translational success rate. One factor might be the choice of stroke model. Whereas the therapeutic responsiveness of permanent focal stroke in humans declines significantly within 3 hours after stroke onset, the therapeutic window in animal models with prompt reperfusion is up to 12 hours, resulting in a much longer action time of the investigated agent. Another major problem of animal stroke models is that studies are mostly conducted in young animals without any comorbidity. These models differ from human stroke, which particularly affects elderly people who have various cerebrovascular risk factors. Choosing the most appropriate stroke model and optimizing the study design of preclinical trials might increase the translational potential of animal stroke models.},

	abstract = {Background
Accelerometers are powerful sensors in many bio-logging devices, and are increasingly allowing researchers to investigate the performance, behaviour, energy expenditure and even state, of free-living animals. Another sensor commonly used in animal-attached loggers is the magnetometer, which has been primarily used in dead-reckoning or inertial measurement tags, but little outside that. We examine the potential of magnetometers for helping elucidate the behaviour of animals in a manner analogous to, but very different from, accelerometers. The particular responses of magnetometers to movement means that there are instances when they can resolve behaviours that are not easily perceived using accelerometers.

Methods
We calibrated the tri-axial magnetometer to rotations in each axis of movement and constructed 3-dimensional plots to inspect these stylised movements. Using the tri-axial data of Daily Diary tags, attached to individuals of number of animal species as they perform different behaviours, we used these 3-d plots to develop a framework with which tri-axial magnetometry data can be examined and introduce metrics that should help quantify movement and behaviour.﻿﻿

Results
Tri-axial magnetometry data reveal patterns in movement at various scales of rotation that are not always evident in acceleration data. Some of these patterns may be obscure until visualised in 3D space as tri-axial spherical plots (m-spheres). A tag-fitted animal that rotates in heading while adopting a constant body attitude produces a ring of data around the pole of the m-sphere that we define as its Normal Operational Plane (NOP). Data that do not lie on this ring are created by postural rotations of the animal as it pitches and/or rolls. Consequently, stereotyped behaviours appear as specific trajectories on the sphere (m-prints), reflecting conserved sequences of postural changes (and/or angular velocities), which result from the precise relationship between body attitude and heading. This novel approach shows promise for helping researchers to identify and quantify behaviours in terms of animal body posture, including heading.

Conclusion
Magnetometer-based techniques and metrics can enhance our capacity to identify and examine animal behaviour, either as a technique used alone, or one that is complementary to tri-axial accelerometry.

A dietary approach (Fortasyn) including docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, uridine, choline, phospholipids, folic acid, vitamins B12, B6, C, and E, and selenium has been proposed for dietary management of AD. We hypothesize that the diet could inhibit AD-like pathologies in apoE4 mice, specifically cerebrovascular and connectivity impairment. Moreover, we evaluated the diet effect on cerebral blood flow (CBF), functional connectivity (FC), gray/white matter integrity, and postsynaptic density in aging apoE4 mice. At 10-12 months, apoE4 mice did not display prominent pathological differences compared to wild-type (WT) mice. However, 16-18-month-old apoE4 mice revealed reduced CBF and accelerated synaptic loss. The diet increased cortical CBF and amount of synapses and improved white matter integrity and FC in both aging apoE4 and WT mice. We demonstrated that protective mechanisms on vascular and synapse health are enhanced by Fortasyn, independent of apoE genotype. We further showed the efficacy of a multimodal translational approach, including advanced MR neuroimaging, to study dietary intervention on brain structure and function in aging.},

We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF) and water diffusivity with ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging, as alterations in these parameters correlate with clinical symptoms of the disease. APPswe/PS1dE9 mice on control diet showed decreased CBF and changes in brain water diffusion, in accordance with findings of hypoperfusion, axonal disconnection and neuronal loss in patients with AD. Both multinutrient diets were able to increase cortical CBF in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice and Fortasyn reduced water diffusivity, particularly in the dentate gyrus and in cortical regions.

We quantified the annual migration cycle of juvenile southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii; SBT) and spatiotemporal variability in this cycle, based on a multi-decadal electronic tagging dataset. Behaviour-switching models allowed for the identification of cohesive areas of residency and classified the temporal sequence of movements within a migration cycle from austral summer foraging grounds in the Great Australian Bight (GAB) to winter foraging grounds in the Indian Ocean and Tasman Sea and back to the GAB. Although specific regions within the Indian Ocean were frequented, individuals did not always return to the same area in consecutive years. Outward migrations from the GAB were typically longer than return migrations back to the GAB. The timing of individual arrivals to the GAB, which may be driven by seasonality in prey availability, was more cohesive than the timing of departures from the GAB, which may be subject to the physiological condition of SBT. A valuable fishery for SBT operates in the GAB, as do a number of scientific research programs designed to monitor SBT for management purposes; thus, understanding SBT migration to and from the area is of high importance to a number of stakeholders.},

Identification of state transitions and bout lengths appear specific to individuals and may identify dissimilar strategies of resource selection, behavior-specific habitats that are more important than is simply suggested by time spent there (pattern) and transitions between the same or different states that may be evidence for decision-making (process).

Alternative partitions of these spatial trajectories are generated by splitting each of the related angle, velocity and pressure profiles into two regions representing both high and low activity. The overall process can be thought of as one that exploits inter-feature dependencies by decomposing signature trajectories based upon angle, velocity and pressure - information quite characteristic to an individualpsilas signature. In the verification phase, distances of each partitioned trajectory of a test signature are calculated against a similarly partitioned template trajectory for a known signer. Finally, these distances become inputs to Fisherpsilas Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLD).

	abstract = {Goal: The main purpose of the present study was to propose a recognizing method to analyze characteristics of symmetric lifting of skilled logistic experts by center of pressure (CoP) trajectories. Although it has been known that good posture helps reduce the intradiscal loads on lumbar discs, the most significant problem was that most of logistic workers did not know whether the current posture was proper or not. Methods : The experiment of lifting was performed three times under 18 kg loads with closed eyes. Six skilled logistic experts and six unskilled beginners were participated in. The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was designed by seven indices which were derived from measured CoP trajectories with the Wii Balance Board. The strong point of experimental system was practical, reliable, and cheap. Results : As a result, it was found that the designed LDA discriminated difference of symmetric lifting between skilled experts and unskilled beginners with the error rate of 0.005. Discussion : It was discussed that not only most of unskilled beginners had mainly characteristics of poor lifting posture, but also the proposed method showed a high possibility to self-evaluate the symmetric lifting in order to check whether the current posture of logistic worker is proper or not.},

By assuming that movement is a correlated random walk, we derive a formula that relates expected square displacements to the number of consecutive moves. We show this displacement formula can be used to highlight the consequences of different searching behaviors (i.e. different probability distributions of turning angles or move lengths). Observations of Pieris rapae (cabbage white butterfly) flight and Battus philenor (pipe-vine swallowtail) crawling are analyzed as a correlated random walk. The formula that we derive aptly predicts that net displacements of ovipositing cabbage white butterflies. In other circumstances, however, net displacements are not well-described by our correlated random walk formula; in these examples movement must represent a more complicated process than a simple correlated random walk. We suggest that progress might be made by analyzing these more complicated cases in terms of higher order markov processes.},

Secondly, suitable distance metric. Many researches try to find or develop suitable distance metric which can measure the divergence between trajectories effectively and reliably. Thirdly, other studies attempt to improve existing algorithms to find outliers with less time and space complexity, and even more reliable. In this paper, we survey and summarize some classic trajectory outlier detection algorithms.

	abstract = {Behavioural changes that occur as animals become sick have been characterized in a number of species and include the less frequent occurrence of ‘luxury behaviours’ such as playing, grooming and socialization. ‘Sickness behaviours’ or behavioural changes following exposure to infectious agents, have been particularly well described; animals are typically less active, sleep more, exhibit postural changes and consume less food/water. Disease is frequently induced in laboratory mice to model pathophysiological processes and investigate potential therapies but despite what is known about behavioural changes as animals become sick, behavioural phenotyping of mice involved in disease studies is relatively rare. A detailed understanding of how behaviour changes as mice get sick could be applied to improve welfare of laboratory mice and support the underlying biomedical research. Specifically, characterizing behavioural changes in ill health could help those working with laboratory mice to recognize when refinements should be introduced, when severity limits are being approached and when humane endpoints should be implemented. Understanding how behaviour changes with illness may also help to identify compounds that have a clinical effect as well as when these agents act. There are an increasing number of automated systems to monitor the behaviour of laboratory mice in their homecages incorporating technologies such as the quantification of cage movement, automated video analysis and radiofrequency identification transponders/readers. Mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases particularly Huntington's disease have been well characterized using these systems and behavioural biomarkers of pathology, including changes in the animals’ use of environmental enrichment, changes in food/water consumption and alterations in circadian rhythms, are now monitored by laboratories worldwide and used to refine studies and develop therapies. In contrast, automated behavioural technologies have not been used to characterize the behaviour of mice with systemic diseases such as cancer and liver disease. In this review, common behavioural changes that occur in animals with declining health will be discussed with an emphasis on progressive disease studies involving mice. Automated homecage behaviour recording technologies will then be summarized, studies in which these systems have been used to characterize the behaviour of mice with progressive diseases will be reviewed and the potential to apply automated technologies to refine disease studies involving mice will be discussed.},

	abstract = {The explosive popularity of e-commerce sites has reshaped users» shopping habits and an increasing number of users prefer to spend more time shopping online. This evolution allows e-commerce sites to observe rich data about users. The majority of traditional recommender systems have focused on the macro interactions between users and items, i.e., the purchase history of a customer. However, within each macro interaction between a user and an item, the user actually performs a sequence of micro behaviors, which indicate how the user locates the item, what activities the user conducts on the item (e.g., reading the comments, carting, and ordering) and how long the user stays with the item. Such micro behaviors offer fine-grained and deep understandings about users and provide tremendous opportunities to advance recommender systems in e-commerce. However, exploiting micro behaviors for recommendations is rather limited, which motivates us to investigate e-commerce recommendations from a micro-behavior perspective in this paper. Particularly, we uncover the effects of micro behaviors on recommendations and propose an interpretable Recommendation framework RIB, which models inherently the sequence of mIcro Behaviors and their effects. Experimental results on datasets from a real e-commence site demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the importance of micro behaviors for recommendations.},

This interaction may influence behaviour, general well-being, and the metabolism of the animal, affecting the phenotypic outcome even if the data collection method is automated. Most of the commercially available solutions for home-cage monitoring are expensive and usually lack the flexibility to be incorporated with existing home-cages. Here we present a low-cost solution for monitoring home-cage behaviour of rodents that can be easily incorporated to practically any available rodent home-cage. To demonstrate the use of our system, we reliably predict the sleep/wake state of mice in their home-cage using only video. We validate these results using hippocampal local field potential (LFP) and electromyography (EMG) data. Our approach provides a low-cost flexible methodology for high-throughput studies of sleep, circadian rhythm and rodent behaviour with minimal experimenter interference.},

To overcome the challenge of capturing the underlying latent factors in the low-dimensional and heterogeneous feature space imposed by GPS data, we develop a novel representation that embeds the original feature space into another space that can be understood as a form of basis expansion. We also enrich the feature space via segment-based information and use Maxout activations to improve the predictive power of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). We achieve over 98\% classification accuracy when detecting four types of transportation modes, outperforming existing models without additional sensory data or location-based prior knowledge.},

After ischemic stroke, damaged tissue surrounding the irreversibly damaged core of the infarct, the penumbra, is still salvageable and is therefore a target for acute therapeutic strategies. The Mediterranean diet (MD) has been shown to lower stroke risk. MD is characterized by increased intake of extra-virgin olive oil, of which hydroxytyrosol (HT) is the foremost phenolic component. This study investigates the effect of an HT-enriched diet directly after stroke on regaining motor and cognitive functioning, MRI parameters, neuroinflammation, and neurogenesis. Stroke mice on an HT diet showed increased strength in the forepaws, as well as improved short-term recognition memory probably due to improvement in functional connectivity (FC). Moreover, mice on an HT diet showed increased cerebral blood flow (CBF) and also heightened expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf), indicating a novel neurogenic potential of HT. This result was additionally accompanied by an enhanced transcription of the postsynaptic marker postsynaptic density protein 95 (Psd-95) and by a decreased ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA-1) level indicative of lower neuroinflammation. These results suggest that an HT-enriched diet could serve as a beneficial therapeutic approach to attenuate ischemic stroke-associated damage.},

In this work we introduce a home cage-home rack monitoring system that is capable of continuously detecting spontaneous animal activity occurring in the home cage directly from the home cage rack. The proposed system is based on an electrical capacitance sensing technology that enables non-intrusive and continuous home cage monitoring. We then present a few animal activity metrics that are validated via comparison against a video camera-based tracking system. The results show that the proposed home-cage monitoring system can provide animal activity metrics that are comparable to the ones derived via a conventional video tracking system, with the advantage of system scalability, limited amount of both data generated and computational capabilities required to derive metrics.},

	abstract = {Background and aims
Automated recording of laboratory animal’s home cage behavior is receiving increasing attention since such non-intruding surveillance will aid in the unbiased understanding of animal cage behavior potentially improving animal experimental reproducibility.

Material and methods
Here we investigate activity of group held female C57BL/6J mice (mus musculus) housed in standard Individually Ventilated Cages across three test-sites: Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR, Rome, Italy), The Jackson Laboratory (JAX, Bar Harbor, USA) and Karolinska Insititutet (KI, Stockholm, Sweden). Additionally, comparison of female and male C57BL/6J mice was done at KI. Activity was recorded using a capacitive-based sensor placed non-intrusively on the cage rack under the home cage collecting activity data every 250 msec, 24/7. The data collection was analyzed using non-parametric analysis of variance for longitudinal data comparing sites, weekdays and sex.

Results
The system detected an increase in activity preceding and peaking around lights-on followed by a decrease to a rest pattern. At lights off, activity increased substantially displaying a distinct temporal variation across this period. We also documented impact on mouse activity that standard animal handling procedures have, e.g. cage-changes, and show that such procedures are stressors impacting in-cage activity., These key observations replicated across the three test-sites, however, it is also clear that, apparently minor local environmental differences generate significant behavioral variances between the sites and within sites across weeks. Comparison of gender revealed differences in activity in the response to cage-change lasting for days in male but not female mice; and apparently also impacting the response to other events such as lights-on in males. Females but not males showed a larger tendency for week-to-week variance in activity possibly reflecting estrous cycling.

Conclusions
These data demonstrate that home cage monitoring is scalable and run in real time, providing complementary information for animal welfare measures, experimental design and phenotype characterization.},

In particular, we take into account heterogeneous interactions that implicitly accounts for the varying shapes, dynamics, and behaviors of different road agents. In addition, we model horizon-based interactions which are used to implicitly model the driving behavior of each road-agent. We evaluate the performance of our prediction algorithm, TraPHic, on the standard datasets and also introduce a new dense, heterogeneous traffic dataset corresponding to urban Asian videos and agent trajectories. We outperform state-of-the-art methods on dense traffic datasets by 30\%.},

To facilitate the training, the network is learned with an auxiliary task of predicting future location in which the activity will happen. Experimental results demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance over two public benchmarks on future trajectory prediction. Moreover, our method is able to produce meaningful future activity prediction in addition to the path. The result provides the first empirical evidence that joint modeling of paths and activities benefits future path prediction.},

As GANs are very susceptible to mode collapsing and dropping, we show that the recently proposed Info-GAN allows dramatic improvements in multi-modal pedestrian trajectory prediction to avoid these issues. We also left out L2-loss in training the generator, unlike some previous works, because it causes serious mode collapsing though faster convergence. We show through experiments on real and synthetic data that the proposed method leads to generate more diverse samples and to preserve the modes of the predictive distribution. In particular, to prove this claim, we have designed a toy example dataset of trajectories that can be used to assess the performance of different methods in preserving the predictive distribution modes.},

	abstract = {Laboratory conditions in biobehavioral experiments are commonly assumed to be ‘controlled’, having little impact on the outcome. However, recent studies have illustrated that the laboratory environment has a robust effect on behavioral traits. Given that environmental factors can interact with trait-relevant genes, some have questioned the reliability and generalizability of behavior genetic research designed to identify those genes. This problem might be alleviated by the identification of the most relevant environmental factors, but the task is hindered by the large number of factors that typically vary between and within laboratories. We used a computational approach to retrospectively identify and rank sources of variability in nociceptive responses as they occurred in a typical research laboratory over several years. A machine-learning algorithm was applied to an archival data set of 8034 independent observations of baseline thermal nociceptive sensitivity. This analysis revealed that a factor even more important than mouse genotype was the experimenter performing the test, and that nociception can be affected by many additional laboratory factors including season/humidity, cage density, time of day, sex and within-cage order of testing. The results were confirmed by linear modeling in a subset of the data, and in confirmatory experiments, in which we were able to partition the variance of this complex trait among genetic (27\%), environmental (42\%) and genetic×environmental (18\%) sources.},

	abstract = {In many areas of animal behaviour research, improvements in our ability to collect large and detailed data sets are outstripping our ability to analyse them. These diverse, complex and often high-dimensional data sets exhibit nonlinear dependencies and unknown interactions across multiple variables, and may fail to conform to the assumptions of many classical statistical methods. The field of machine learning provides methodologies that are ideally suited to the task of extracting knowledge from these data. In this review, we aim to introduce animal behaviourists unfamiliar with machine learning (ML) to the promise of these techniques for the analysis of complex behavioural data. We start by describing the rationale behind ML and review a number of animal behaviour studies where ML has been successfully deployed. The ML framework is then introduced by presenting several unsupervised and supervised learning methods. Following this overview, we illustrate key ML approaches by developing data analytical pipelines for three different case studies that exemplify the types of behavioural and ecological questions ML can address. The first uses a large number of spectral and morphological characteristics that describe the appearance of pheasant, Phasianus colchicus, eggs to assign them to putative clutches. The second takes a continuous data stream of feeder visits from PIT (passive integrated transponder)-tagged jackdaws, Corvus monedula, and extracts foraging events from it, which permits the construction of social networks. Our final example uses aerial images to train a classifier that detects the presence of wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus, to count individuals in a population. With the advent of cheaper sensing and tracking technologies an unprecedented amount of data on animal behaviour is becoming available. We believe that ML will play a central role in translating these data into scientific knowledge and become a useful addition to the animal behaviourist's analytical toolkit.},

In order to improve stroke outcome, novel treatment approaches as well as animal stroke models predictive for the clinical setting are of urgent need. One of the main obstacles in experimental stroke research is measuring long-term outcome, in particular in mouse models of stroke. On the other hand, assessing functional deficits in animal models of stroke is critical to improve the prediction of preclinical findings. Automated gait analysis provides a sensitive tool to examine locomotion and limb coordination in small rodents. Comparing mice before and 10 days after experimental stroke (60 min MCAo) we observed a significant decrease in maximum contact area, stride length and swing speed in the hind limbs, especially the contralateral one. Mice showed a disturbed interlimb coordination represented by changes in regularity index and phase dispersion. To assess whether gait analysis is applicable to assess improvements by neuroprotective compounds, we applied a model calculation and approached common statistical problems. In conclusion, gait analysis is a promising tool to assess mid- to long-term outcome in experimental stroke research.},

	abstract = {Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats is a well-studied experimental model for ischemic stroke leading to brain infarction and functional deficits. Many preclinical studies have focused on a small time window after the ischemic episode to evaluate functional outcome for screening therapeutic candidates. Short evaluation periods following injury have led to significant setbacks due to lack of information on the delayed effects of treatments, as well as short-lived and reversible neuroprotection, so called false-positive results. In this report, we evaluated long-term functional deficit for 90 days after MCAO in two rat strains with two durations of ischemic insult, in order to identify the best experimental paradigm to assess injury and subsequent recovery. Behavioral outcomes were measured pre-MCAO followed by weekly assessment post-stroke. Behavioral tests included the 18-point composite neurological score, 28-point neuroscore, rearing test, vibrissae-evoked forelimb placing test, foot fault test and the CatWalk. Brain lesions were assessed to correlate injury to behavior outcomes at the end of study. Our results indicate that infarction volume in Sprague-Dawley rats was dependent on occlusion duration. In contrast, the infarction volume in Wistar rats did not correlate with the duration of ischemic episode. Functional outcomes were not dependent on occlusion time in either strain; however, measureable deficits were detectable long-term in limb asymmetry, 18- and 28-point neuroscores, forelimb placing, paw swing speed, and gait coordination. In conclusion, these behavioral assays, in combination with an extended long-term assessment period, can be used for evaluating therapeutic candidates in preclinical models of ischemic stroke.},

	abstract = {Stroke is one of the common causes of death and disability. Despite extensive efforts in stroke research, therapeutic options for improving the functional recovery remain limited in clinical practice. Experimental stroke models using genetically modified mice could aid in unraveling the complex pathophysiology triggered by ischemic brain injury. Here, we optimized the procedure for generating mouse stroke model using an intraluminal suture in the middle cerebral artery and verified the blockage of blood flow using indocyanine green coupled with near infra-red radiation. The first week after the ischemic injury was critical for survivability. The survival rate of 11\% in mice without any treatment but increased to 60\% on administering prophylactic antibiotics. During this period, mice showed severe functional impairment but recovered spontaneously starting from the second week onward. Among the various behavioral tests, the pole tests and neurological severity score tests remained reliable up to 4 weeks after ischemia, whereas the rotarod and corner tests became less sensitive for assessing the severity of ischemic injury with time. Further, loss of body weight was also observed for up 4 weeks after ischemia induction. In conclusion, we have developed an improved approach which allows us to investigate the role of the cell death-related genes in the disease progression using genetically modified mice and to evaluate the modes of action of candidate drugs.},

Despite the advantages that video offers, our experience has been that video systems cannot track a mouse consistently when its coat color is in low contrast with the background. Furthermore, the local lab lighting can influence how well results are quantified. To test the effect of lighting, we built devices that provide a known path length for any given trial duration, at a velocity close to the average speed of a mouse in the open-field and the circular water maze. We found that the validity of results from two commercial video tracking systems (ANY-maze and EthoVision XT) depends greatly on the level of contrast and the quality of the lighting. A photocell detection system was immune to lighting problems but yielded a path length that deviated from the true length. Excellent precision was achieved consistently, however, with video tracking using infrared backlighting in both the open field and water maze. A high correlation (r=0.98) between the two software systems was observed when infrared backlighting was used with live mice.},

The system takes an analog video signal, digitizes each frame, and analyses the resultant pixels to determine the location of the tracked animals (as well as other data). Calculations are performed on a series of frames to derive a set of quantitative descriptors of the animal's movement. EthoVision (from Noldus Information Technology) is a specific example of such a system, and its functionality that is particularly relevant to transgenic mice studies is described. Key practical aspects of using the EthoVision system are also outlined, including tips about lighting, marking animals, the arena size, and sample rate. Four case studies are presented, illustrating various aspects of the system: (1) The effects of disabling the Munc 18-1 gene were clearly shown using the straightforward measure of how long the mice took to enter a zone in an open field. (2) Differences in exploratory behavior between short and long attack latency mice strains were quantified by measuring the time spent in inner and outer zones of an open field. (3) Mice with hypomorphic CREB alleles were shown to perform less well in a water maze, but this was only clear when a range of different variables were calculated from their tracks. (4) Mice with the trkB receptor knocked out in the forebrain also performed poorly in a water maze, and it was immediately apparent from examining plots of the tracks that this was due to thigmotaxis. Some of the latest technological developments and possible future directions for video tracking systems are briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {The advent of automated locomotor activity methodologies has been extremely useful in removing the subjectivity and bias out of measuring this parameter in rodents. However, many of these behavioural studies are still conducted in novel environments, rather than in ones that the animals are familiar with, such as their home cage. The purpose of the present series of experiments was to develop an automated home cage tracking (HCT) profile using EthoVision® software and assessing the acute effects of stimulant (amphetamine and methamphetamine, 0–5 mg/kg, sc) and sedative (diazepam, 0–20 mg/kg, sc and chlordiazepoxide, 0–50 mg/kg sc) drugs in this apparatus. Young adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were used, and the home cage locomotor activity was recorded for 11–60 min following administration (n=4 per group). For amphetamine and methamphetamine, a dose-dependent increase in home cage activity was evident for both drugs, with a plateau, followed by reduction at higher doses. Methamphetamine was more potent, whereas amphetamine produced greater maximal responses. Both diazepam and chlordiazepoxide dose-dependently reduced locomotor activity, with diazepam exhibiting a greater potency and having stronger sedative effects than chlordiazepoxide. Three doses of each drug were selected at the 31–40 min time period following administration, and compared to open field responses. Diazepam, chlordiazepoxide and amphetamine did not produce significant changes in the open field, whilst methamphetamine produced a significant increase in the 2.5 mg/kg group. In conclusion, these studies have successfully developed a sensitive HCT methodology that has been validated using drugs with stimulant and sedative properties in the same test conditions, with relatively small numbers of animals required to produce statistically significant results. It has proven superior to the open field investigations in allowing dose-response effects to be observed over a relatively short observation period (i.e. 10 min) for both stimulants and sedatives. In addition, the HCT system can determine differences in potency and efficacy between drugs of a similar chemical class.},

That is, it can at once measure and directly analyze detailed changes in animal activity ranging from locomotion to tremor. The main advantages of this combined system are that it features real time data acquisition with the option of animated real time or recorded display/playback of the animal’s motion. Additionally, under the multi-task operating condition of IBM PC, it can acquire and process behavior using both IR and ultrasound systems simultaneously. Traditional systems have had to make separate runs for gross and fine movement recording. This combined system can be profitably employed for normative behavioral activity studies and for neurological and pharmacological research.},

A monitoring system was developed that consisted of an open field of 1m in diameter with a black surface, an infrared digital camera and a video capture card. The animals were filmed for 2min as they moved freely in the field. The images were sent to a computer connected to the camera. Afterwards, the videos were analyzed using software developed using MATLAB® (mathematical software). The software was able to recognize the pixels constituting the image and extract the following parameters: distance traveled, average speed, average potency, time immobile, number of stops, time spent in different areas of the field and time immobile/number of stops. All data were exported for further analysis. The system was able to effectively extract the desired parameters. Thus, it was possible to observe developmental changes in the patterns of movement of the animals. We also discuss similarities and differences between this system and previously described systems.},

We demonstrate how it can become an asset offering a quantitative criterion that guides the design of better ways to describe behavior. Passing the high benchmark dictated by the replicability demand requires less stressful and less restraining experimental setups, less noisy data, individually customized cutoff points between the building blocks of movement, and less variable yet discriminative dynamic representations that would capture more faithfully the nature of the behavior, unmasking similarities and differences and revealing novel animal-centered measures. Here we review ten tools that enhance replicability without compromising discrimination. While we demonstrate the usefulness of these tools in the context of inbred mouse exploratory behavior they can readily be used in any study involving a high-resolution analysis of spatial behavior. Viewing replicability as a design concept and using the ten methodological improvements may prove useful in many fields not necessarily related to spatial behavior.},

Substantial advances have occurred regarding the appropriate quality and breadth of preclinical testing for candidate acute stroke therapies for better clinical translation. The updated STAIR preclinical recommendations reinforce the previous suggestions that reproducibly defining dose response and time windows with both histological and functional outcomes in multiple animal species with appropriate physiological monitoring is appropriate. The updated STAIR recommendations include: the fundamentals of good scientific inquiry should be followed by eliminating randomization and assessment bias, a priori defining inclusion/exclusion criteria, performing appropriate power and sample size calculations, and disclosing potential conflicts of interest. After initial evaluations in young, healthy male animals, further studies should be performed in females, aged animals, and animals with comorbid conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. Another consideration is the use of clinically relevant biomarkers in animal studies. Although the recommendations cannot be validated until effective therapies based on them emerge from clinical trials, it is hoped that adherence to them might enhance the chances for success.},

	doi = {10.3791/2423},
	abstract = {Stroke is among the most frequent causes of death and adult disability, especially in highly developed countries. However, treatment options to date are very limited. To meet the need for novel therapeutic approaches, experimental stroke research frequently employs rodent models of focal cerebral ischaemia. Most researchers use permanent or transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in mice or rats. Proximal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) via the intraluminal suture technique (so called filament or suture model) is probably the most frequently used model in experimental stroke research. The intraluminal MCAO model offers the advantage of inducing reproducible transient or permanent ischaemia of the MCA territory in a relatively non-invasive manner. Intraluminal approaches interrupt the blood flow of the entire territory of this artery. Filament occlusion thus arrests flow proximal to the lenticulo-striate arteries, which supply the basal ganglia. Filament occlusion of the MCA results in reproducible lesions in the cortex and striatum and can be either permanent or transient. In contrast, models inducing distal (to the branching of the lenticulo-striate arteries) MCA occlusion typically spare the striatum and primarily involve the neocortex. In addition these models do require craniectomy. In the model demonstrated in this article, a silicon coated filament is introduced into the common carotid artery and advanced along the internal carotid artery into the Circle of Willis, where it blocks the origin of the middle cerebral artery. In patients, occlusions of the middle cerebral artery are among the most common causes of ischaemic stroke. Since varying ischemic intervals can be chosen freely in this model depending on the time point of reperfusion, ischaemic lesions with varying degrees of severity can be produced. Reperfusion by removal of the occluding filament at least partially models the restoration of blood flow after spontaneous or therapeutic (tPA) lysis of a thromboembolic clot in humans. In this video we will present the basic technique as well as the major pitfalls and confounders which may limit the predictive value of this model.},

Mice normally use a single “trotting” gait while running at all speeds, either over ground or on a treadmill. Transgenic mouse mutants in which the trotting is replaced by hopping also lack a speed-dependent change in gait. Here we describe a transgenic mouse model in which the V2a interneurons have been ablated by targeted expression of diphtheria toxin A chain (DTA) under the control of the Chx10 gene promoter (Chx10::DTA mice). Chx10::DTA mice show normal trotting gait at slow speeds but transition to a galloping gait as speed increases. Although left–right limb coordination is altered in Chx10::DTA mice at fast speed, alternation of forelegs and hindlegs and the relative duration of swing and stance phases for individual limbs is unchanged compared with wild-type mice. The speed-dependent loss of left–right alternation is recapitulated during drug-induced fictive locomotion in spinal cords isolated from neonatal Chx10::DTA mice, and high-speed fictive locomotion evoked by caudal spinal cord stimulation also shows synchronous left–right bursting. These results show that spinal V2a interneurons are required for maintaining left–right alternation at high speeds. Whether animals that generate galloping or hopping gaits, characterized by synchronous movement of left and right forelegs and hindlegs, have lost or modified the function of V2a interneurons is an intriguing question.},

Genotypes for 342 microsatellite markers and performance in three behavioral tests (rotorod, open field activity and habituation, and contextual and cued fear conditioning) were determined. C57BL/6J and C57BL/6NTac were found to be true substrains; there were only 12 microsatellite differences between them. Given the data on the genetic background, one might predict that the two C57BL/6 substrains should be very similar behaviorally. Indeed, there were no significant behavioral differences between C57BL/6J and C57BL/6NTac. Contrary to literature reports on other 129 strains, 129S6/SvEvTac often performed similarly to C57BL/6 strains, except that it was less active. FVB/NTac showed impaired rotorod learning and cued fear conditioning. Therefore, both 129S6/SvEvTac and C57BL/6 are recommended as background strains for targeted mutations when researchers want to evaluate their mice in any of these three behavior tests. However, any transgene on the FVB/NTac background should be transferred to B6. Habituation to the open field was analyzed using the parameters: total distance, center distance, velocity and vertical activity. Contrary to earlier studies, we found that all strains habituated to the open field in at least two of these parameters (center distance and velocity).},

The Catwalk system was used to assess behavioral changes in freely moving mice. The effects of indomethacin on changes in LPS-inoculated mice were examined.
KEY FINDINGS: Mice inoculated with LPS into the RH limb showed reduced paw pressure (measured as light intensity) and print area on the RH limb, whereas they exerted more pressure with the left hind (LH) and front limbs, showing a transfer of weight bearing from RH to LH and front limbs, which was significant at 2 days post-LPS inoculation. There were no differences between the front limbs. No changes were observed in the PBS injected controls. There were no changes in interlimb coordination (regularity index) in both PBS- and LPS-injected mice. Treatment with indomethacin (10 and 100mg/kg) restored the weight bearing (measured as the ratio of the pressure exerted by the paws) and the print area ratios of LPS-inoculated mice similar to that observed in control mice.
SIGNIFICANCE: This study shows that the Catwalk gait analysis system can be used to objectively quantify LPS-induced monoarthritis weight bearing changes in all four limbs and evaluate pharmacological antinociception in freely moving mice.},

We applied a noninvasive imaging method to quantitatively compare the gait dynamics of Ts65Dn mice (n=10) to their euploid littermates (controls) (n=10). The braking duration of the hind limbs in Ts65Dn mice was prolonged compared to that in control mice (60+/-3 ms vs. 49+/-2 ms, P{\textless}.05) at a slow walking speed (18 cm/s). Stride length and stride frequency of forelimbs and hind limbs were comparable between Ts65Dn mice and control mice. Stride dynamics were significantly different in Ts65Dn mice at a faster walking speed (36 cm/s). Stride length was shorter in Ts65Dn mice (5.9+/-0.1 vs. 6.3+/-0.3 cm, P{\textless}.05), and stride frequency was higher in Ts65Dn compared to control mice (5.9+/-0.1 vs. 5.3+/-0.1 strides/s, P{\textless}.05). Hind limb swing duration was prolonged in Ts65Dn mice compared to control mice (93+/-3 vs. 76+/-3 ms, P{\textless}.05). Propulsion of the forelimbs contributed to a significantly larger percentage of stride duration in Ts65Dn mice than in control mice at the faster walking speed. Indices of gait dynamics in Ts65Dn mice correspond to previously reported findings in children with DS. The methods used in the present study provide quantitative markers for genotype and phenotype relationship studies in DS. This technique may provide opportunities for testing the efficacy of therapies for motor dysfunction in persons with DS.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gait is impaired in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD), but gait dynamics in mouse models of PD and HD have not been described. Here we quantified temporal and spatial indices of gait dynamics in a mouse model of PD and a mouse model of HD.
METHODS: Gait indices were obtained in C57BL/6J mice treated with the dopaminergic neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP, 30 mg/kg/day for 3 days) for PD, the mitochondrial toxin 3-nitropropionic acid (3NP, 75 mg/kg cumulative dose) for HD, or saline. We applied ventral plane videography to generate digital paw prints from which indices of gait and gait variability were determined. Mice walked on a transparent treadmill belt at a speed of 34 cm/s after treatments.
RESULTS: Stride length was significantly shorter in MPTP-treated mice (6.6 +/- 0.1 cm vs. 7.1 +/- 0.1 cm, P {\textless} 0.05) and stride frequency was significantly increased (5.4 +/- 0.1 Hz vs. 5.0 +/- 0.1 Hz, P {\textless} 0.05) after 3 administrations of MPTP, compared to saline-treated mice. The inability of some mice treated with 3NP to exhibit coordinated gait was due to hind limb failure while forelimb gait dynamics remained intact. Stride-to-stride variability was significantly increased in MPTP-treated and 3NP-treated mice compared to saline-treated mice. To determine if gait disturbances due to MPTP and 3NP, drugs affecting the basal ganglia, were comparable to gait disturbances associated with motor neuron diseases, we also studied gait dynamics in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Gait variability was not increased in the SOD1 G93A transgenic model of ALS compared to wild-type control mice.
CONCLUSION: The distinct characteristics of gait and gait variability in the MPTP model of Parkinson's disease and the 3NP model of Huntington's disease may reflect impairment of specific neural pathways involved.},

	abstract = {Results of our previous studies have shown that the slow, shuffling gait of Parkinson's disease patients is due to an inability to generate appropriate stride length and that cadence control is intact and is used as a compensatory mechanism. The reason for the reduced stride length is unclear, although deficient internal cue production or inadequate contribution to cortical motor set by the basal ganglia are two possible explanations. In this study we have examined the latter possibility by comparing the long-lasting effects of visual cues in improving stride length with that of attentional strategies. Computerized stride analysis was used to measure the spatial (distance) and temporal (timing) parameters of the walking pattern in a total of 54 subjects in three separate studies. In each study Parkinson's disease subjects were trained for 20 min by repeated 10 m walks set at control stride length (determined from control subjects matched for age, sex and height), using either visual floor markers or a mental picture of the appropriate stride size. Following training, the gait patterns were monitored (i) every 15 min for 2 h; (ii) whilst interspersing secondary tasks of increasing levels of complexity; (iii) covertly, when subjects were unaware that measurement was taking place. The results demonstrated that training with both visual cues and attentional strategies could maintain normal gait for the maximum recording time of 2 h. Secondary tasks reduced stride length towards baseline values as did covert monitoring. The findings confirm that the ability to generate a normal stepping pattern is not lost in Parkinson's disease and that gait hypokinesia reflects a difficulty in activating the motor control system. Normal stride length can be elicited in Parkinson's disease using attentional strategies and visual cues. Both strategies appear to share the same mechanism of focusing attention on the stride length. The effect of attention appears to require constant vigilance to prevent reverting to more automatic control mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Observations in cats of flexion and extension movements of the 4 limbs have led to the conclusion that the different forms of alternative locomotion (e.g. walking, trotting, swimming) and in-phase locomotion (galloping, jumping) result from the interaction of 'programmes' for the coordination of (1) the homologous limbs (pair of hindlimbs or pair of forelimbs) and (2) the homolateral limbs (hind- and forelimb of the same side of the body). The movements of the homologous pairs of limbs are coupled out of phase in alternate locomotion and approximately in phase in the phase form of locomotion. The movements of the homolateral pairs of limbs occur approximately out of phase in the trotting type of coupling and approximately in phase in the pacing type of coupling. Transitions between the different forms of coupling occur abruptly over 1 or 2 steps. Therefore, for each type of coupling (homologous or homolateral) there are two distinct forms or 'programmes' of movement. The hypothesis is advanced that (a) all the characteristic patterns of locomotion in the cat result from different combinations of these 'programmes' of homologous and homolateral limb coupling; (b) the 'programmes' are mutually self reinforcing in the gaits in which the coordination of the movements of the 4 limbs is bilaterally symmetrical; (c) the 'programmes' act in competition in certain gaits which are not bilaterally symmetrical giving rise at times to a changing gait pattern, and (d) the temporary dominance of one 'programme' or another can determine the gait of the particular step.},

After partial SCI, however, the role of this spinal CPG in the recovery of hindlimb locomotion in the cat remains mostly unknown. In the present work, we devised a dual-lesion paradigm to determine its possible contribution after partial SCI. After a partial section of the left thoracic segment T10 or T11, cats gradually recovered voluntary quadrupedal locomotion. Then, a complete transection was performed two to three segments more caudally (T13-L1) several weeks after the first partial lesion. Cats that received intensive treadmill training after the partial lesion expressed bilateral hindlimb locomotion within hours of the complete lesion. Untrained cats however showed asymmetrical hindlimb locomotion with the limb on the side of the partial lesion walking well before the other hindlimb. Thus, the complete spinalization revealed that the spinal CPG underwent plastic changes after the partial lesions, which were shaped by locomotor training. Over time, with further treadmill training, the asymmetry disappeared and a bilateral locomotion was reinstated. Therefore, although remnant intact descending pathways must contribute to voluntary goal-oriented locomotion after partial SCI, the recovery and re-expression of the hindlimb locomotor pattern mostly results from intrinsic changes below the lesion in the CPG and afferent inputs.},

Using custom made housing and video tracking software in order to obtain high spatial and temporal resolution, we studied the statistical properties of the locomotor activity of wild type and two clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster. We show here that the distributions of activity and quiescence bouts for the clock mutants in light-dark conditions (LD) are very different from the distributions obtained when there are no external cues from the environment (DD). In the wild type these distributions are very similar, showing that the clock controls this aspect of behavior in both regimes (LD and DD). Furthermore, the distributions are very similar to those reported for Wistar rats. For the timing of events we also observe important differences, quantified by how the event rate distributions scale for increasing time windows. We find that for the wild type these distributions can be rescaled by the same function in DD as in LD. Interestingly, the same function has been shown to rescale the rate distributions in Wistar rats. On the other hand, for the clock mutants it is not possible to rescale the rate distributions, which might indicate that the extent of circadian control depends on the statistical properties of activity and quiescence.},

Cerebral ischemia leads to brain lesions existing of an irreversibly injured core and an ischemic boundary zone, the penumbra, containing damaged but potentially salvageable tissue. Using a transient occlusion (30 min) of the middle cerebral artery (tMCAo) mouse model in this cross-institutional study we investigated the neurorestorative efficacy of a dietary approach (Fortasyn) comprising docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, uridine, choline, phospholipids, folic acid, vitamins B12, B6, C, and E, and selenium as therapeutic approach to counteract neuroinflammation and impairments of cerebral (structural+functional) connectivity, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and motor function. Male adult C57BL/6j mice were subjected to right tMCAo using the intraluminal filament model. Following tMCAo, animals were either maintained on Control diet or switched to the multicomponent Fortasyn diet. At several time points after tMCAo, behavioral tests, and MRI and PET scanning were conducted to identify the impact of the multicomponent diet on the elicited neuroinflammatory response, loss of cerebral connectivity, and the resulting impairment of motor function after experimental stroke. Mice on the multicomponent diet showed decreased neuroinflammation, improved functional and structural connectivity, beneficial effect on CBF, and also improved motor function after tMCAo. Our present data show that this specific dietary intervention may have beneficial effects on structural and functional recovery and therefore therapeutic potential after ischemic stroke.},

Here we review ten tools that enhance replicability without compromising discrimination. While we demonstrate the usefulness of these tools in the context of inbred mouse exploratory behavior they can readily be used in any study involving a high-resolution analysis of spatial behavior. Viewing replicability as a design concept and using the ten methodological improvements may prove useful in many fields not necessarily related to spatial behavior.},

	abstract = {Stroke can affect females very differently from males, and therefore preclinical research on underlying mechanisms and the effects of interventions should not be restricted to male subjects, and treatment strategies for stroke should be tailored to benefit both sexes. Previously, we demonstrated that a multinutrient intervention (Fortasyn) improved impairments after ischemic stroke induction in male C57Bl/6 mice, but the therapeutic potential of this dietary treatment remained to be investigated in females. We now induced a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAo) in C57Bl/6 female mice and immediately after surgery switched to either Fortasyn or an isocaloric Control diet. The stroke females performed several behavioral and motor tasks before and after tMCAo and were scanned in an 11.7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner to assess brain perfusion, integrity, and functional connectivity. To assess brain plasticity, inflammation, and vascular integrity, immunohistochemistry was performed after killing of the mice. We found that the multinutrient intervention had diverse effects on the stroke-induced impairments in females. Similar to previous observations in male stroke mice, brain integrity, sensorimotor integration and neurogenesis benefitted from Fortasyn, but impairments in activity and motor skills were not improved in female stroke mice. Overall, Fortasyn effects in the female stroke mice seem more modest in comparison to previously investigated male stroke mice. We suggest that with further optimization of treatment protocols more information on the efficacy of specific interventions in stroked females can be gathered. This in turn will help with the development of (gender-specific) treatment regimens for cerebrovascular diseases such as stroke.

	abstract = {Highlights•Machine learning (ML) offers a hypothesis-free approach to modelling complex data.•We present a review of ML techniques pertinent to the study of animal behaviour.•Key ML approaches are illustrated using three different case studies.•ML offers a useful addition to the animal behaviourist's analytical toolbox. In many areas of animal behaviour research, improvements in our ability to collect large and detailed data sets are outstripping our ability to analyse them. These diverse, complex and often high-dimensional data sets exhibit nonlinear dependencies and unknown interactions across multiple variables, and may fail to conform to the assumptions of many classical statistical methods. The field of machine learning provides methodologies that are ideally suited to the task of extracting knowledge from these data. In this review, we aim to introduce animal behaviourists unfamiliar with machine learning (ML) to the promise of these techniques for the analysis of complex behavioural data. We start by describing the rationale behind ML and review a number of animal behaviour studies where ML has been successfully deployed. The ML framework is then introduced by presenting several unsupervised and supervised learning methods. Following this overview, we illustrate key ML approaches by developing data analytical pipelines for three different case studies that exemplify the types of behavioural and ecological questions ML can address. The first uses a large number of spectral and morphological characteristics that describe the appearance of pheasant, Phasianus colchicus, eggs to assign them to putative clutches. The second takes a continuous data stream of feeder visits from PIT (passive integrated transponder)-tagged jackdaws, Corvus monedula, and extracts foraging events from it, which permits the construction of social networks. Our final example uses aerial images to train a classifier that detects the presence of wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus, to count individuals in a population. With the advent of cheaper sensing and tracking technologies an unprecedented amount of data on animal behaviour is becoming available. We believe that ML will play a central role in translating these data into scientific knowledge and become a useful addition to the animal behaviourist's analytical toolkit.},

	abstract = {Background Disruption of rhythms in activity and rest occur in many diseases, and provide an important indicator of healthy physiology and behaviour. However, outside the field of sleep and circadian rhythm research, these rhythmic processes are rarely measured due to the requirement for specialised resources and expertise. Until recently, the primary approach to measuring activity in laboratory rodents has been based on voluntary running wheel activity. By contrast, measuring sleep requires the use of electroencephalography (EEG), which involves invasive surgical procedures and time-consuming data analysis. Methods Here we describe a simple, non-invasive system to measure home cage activity in mice based upon passive infrared (PIR) motion sensors. Careful calibration of this system will allow users to simultaneously assess sleep status in mice. The use of open-source tools and simple sensors keeps the cost and the size of data-files down, in order to increase ease of use and uptake. Results In addition to providing accurate data on circadian activity parameters, here we show that extended immobility of {\textbackslash}textgreater40 seconds provides a reliable indicator of sleep, correlating well with EEG-defined sleep (Pearson's r {\textbackslash}textgreater0.95, 4 mice). Conclusions Whilst any detailed analysis of sleep patterns in mice will require EEG, behaviourally-defined sleep provides a valuable non-invasive means of simultaneously phenotyping both circadian rhythms and sleep. Whilst previous approaches have relied upon analysis of video data, here we show that simple motion sensors provide a cheap and effective alternative, enabling real-time analysis and longitudinal studies extending over weeks or even months. The data files produced are small, enabling easy deposition and sharing. We have named this system COMPA{\textbackslash}SS - Continuous Open Mouse Phenotyping of Activity and Sleep Status. This simple approach is of particular value in phenotyping screens as well as providing an ideal tool to assess activity and rest cycles for non-specialists.},

Phenotypes resulting from knockouts of these genes in mice have provided tremendous insight into gene function and congenital disorders. As part of the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium effort to generate and phenotypically characterize 5,000 knockout mouse lines, here we identify 410 lethal genes during the production of the first 1,751 unique gene knockouts. Using a standardized phenotyping platform that incorporates high-resolution 3D imaging, we identify phenotypes at multiple time points for previously uncharacterized genes and additional phenotypes for genes with previously reported mutant phenotypes. Unexpectedly, our analysis reveals that incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity are common even on a defined genetic background. In addition, we show that human disease genes are enriched for essential genes, thus providing a dataset that facilitates the prioritization and validation of mutations identified in clinical sequencing efforts.},

	abstract = {Assessment of sleep in mice currently requires initial implantation of chronic electrodes for assessment of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) followed by time to recover from surgery. Hence, it is not ideal for high-throughput screening. To address this deficiency, a method of assessment of sleep and wakefulness in mice has been developed based on assessment of activity/inactivity either by digital video analysis or by breaking infrared beams in the mouse cage. It is based on the algorithm that any episode of continuous inactivity of {\textbackslash}textgreater or =40 s is predicted to be sleep. The method gives excellent agreement in C57BL/6J male mice with simultaneous assessment of sleep by EEG/EMG recording. The average agreement over 8,640 10-s epochs in 24 h is 92\% (n = 7 mice) with agreement in individual mice being 88-94\%. Average EEG/EMG determined sleep per 2-h interval across the day was 59.4 min. The estimated mean difference (bias) per 2-h interval between inactivity-defined sleep and EEG/EMG-defined sleep was only 1.0 min (95\% confidence interval for mean bias -0.06 to +2.6 min). The standard deviation of differences (precision) was 7.5 min per 2-h interval with 95\% limits of agreement ranging from -13.7 to +15.7 min. Although bias significantly varied by time of day (P = 0.0007), the magnitude of time-of-day differences was not large (average bias during lights on and lights off was +5.0 and -3.0 min per 2-h interval, respectively). This method has applications in chemical mutagenesis and for studies of molecular changes in brain with sleep/wakefulness.},

	abstract = {Circadian rhythms take place with a periodicity of 24 hr, temporally following the rotation of the earth around its axis. Examples of circadian rhythms are the sleep/wake cycle, feeding, and hormone secretion. Light powerfully entrains the mammalian clock and assists in keeping animals synchronized to the 24-hour cycle of the earth by activating specific neurons in the "central pacemaker" of the brain, the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Absolute periodicity of an animal can deviate slightly from 24 hr as manifest when an animal is placed into constant dark or "free-running" conditions. Simple measurements of an organism's activity in free-running conditions reveal its intrinsic circadian period. Mice are a particularly useful model for studying circadian rhythmicity due to the ease of genetic manipulation, thus identifying molecular contributors to rhythmicity. Furthermore, their small size allows for monitoring locomotion or activity in their homecage environment with relative ease. Several tasks commonly used to analyze circadian periodicity and plasticity in mice are presented here including the process of entrainment, determination of tau (period length) in free-running conditions, determination of circadian periodicity in response to light disruption (e.g., jet lag studies), and evaluation of clock plasticity in non-24-hour conditions (T-cycles). Studying the properties of circadian periods such as their phase, amplitude, and length in response to photic perturbation, can be particularly useful in understanding how humans respond to jet lag, night shifts, rotating shifts, or other transient or chronic disruption of environmental surroundings.

Here, we describe an automated approach for the quantitative characterization of fundamental behavioral elements and their patterns in the freely behaving mouse. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by identifying unique features of home cage behavioral structure and changes in distinct levels of behavioral organization in mice with single gene mutations altering energy balance.

A significant age-related decrease in ambulatory and fine motor activity was seen during the first hour of testing (novel environment). In addition, aged rats showed a decreased number of ambulatory and fine movements in home-cage activity, predominantly during the dark portion of the light cycle and during or around both light-switch periods (05:00 and 17:00).

	abstract = {Arm and leg coordination naturally emerges during walking, but can be affected by stroke or Parkinson's disease. The purpose of this preliminary study was to characterize arm and leg coordination during treadmill walking at self-selected comfortable walking speeds (CWSs) in individuals using arm swing with motor incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI). Hip and shoulder angle cycle durations and amplitudes, strength of peak correlations between contralateral hip and shoulder joint angle time series, the time shifts at which these peak correlations occur, and associated variability were quantified. Outcomes in individuals with iSCI selecting fast CWSs (range, 1.0-1.3m/s) and speed-matched individuals without neurological injuries are similar. Differences, however, are detected in individuals with iSCI selecting slow CWSs (range, 0.25-0.65 m/s) and may represent compensatory strategies to improve walking balance or forward propulsion. These individuals elicit a 1:1, arm:leg frequency ratio versus the 2:1 ratio observed in non-injured individuals. Shoulder and hip movement patterns, however, are highly reproducible (coordinated) in participants with iSCI, regardless of CWS. This high degree of inter-extremity coordination could reflect an inability to modify a single movement pattern post-iSCI. Combined, these data suggest inter-extremity walking coordination may be altered, but is present after iSCI, and therefore may be regulated, in part, by neural control. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

OBJECTIVES: Determine the presence of walking-related arm swing after spinal cord injury (SCI), its associated factors and whether arm swing may change after locomotor training (LT). SETTING: Malcom Randall VAMC and University of Florida, Gainesville, FL. METHODS: Arm movement was assessed during treadmill stepping, pre-LT, in 30 individuals with motor incomplete SCI (iSCI, American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale grade C/D, as defined by the International Standards for Neurological Classifications of SCI, with neurological level of impairment at or below C4). Partial body weight support and manual-trainer assistance were provided, as needed, to achieve stepping and allow arm swing. Arm swing presence was compared on the basis of cervical versus thoracic neurological levels of impairment and device type. Leg and arm strength and walking independence were compared between individuals with and without arm swing. Arm swing was reevaluated post-LT in the 21 out of 30 individuals who underwent LT. RESULTS: Of 30 individuals with iSCI, 12 demonstrated arm swing during treadmill stepping, pre-LT. Arm movement was associated with device type, lower extremity motor scores and walking independence. Among the 21 individuals who received LT, only 5 demonstrated arm swing pre-LT. Of the 16 individuals lacking arm swing pre-LT, 8 integrated arm swing post-LT. CONCLUSION: Devices routinely used for walking post-iSCI appeared associated with arm swing. Post-LT, arm swing presence increased. Therefore, arm swing may be experience dependent. Daily neuromuscular experiences provided to the arms may produce training effects, thereby altering arm swing expression.},

MAIN METHODS: LPS or its solvent (PBS) was injected intra-articularly into the right hind (RH) limb ankle joint through the Achilles tendon of C57BL/6 mice. The Catwalk system was used to assess behavioral changes in freely moving mice. The effects of indomethacin on changes in LPS-inoculated mice were examined. KEY FINDINGS: Mice inoculated with LPS into the RH limb showed reduced paw pressure (measured as light intensity) and print area on the RH limb, whereas they exerted more pressure with the left hind (LH) and front limbs, showing a transfer of weight bearing from RH to LH and front limbs, which was significant at 2 days post-LPS inoculation. There were no differences between the front limbs. No changes were observed in the PBS injected controls. There were no changes in interlimb coordination (regularity index) in both PBS- and LPS-injected mice. Treatment with indomethacin (10 and 100mg/kg) restored the weight bearing (measured as the ratio of the pressure exerted by the paws) and the print area ratios of LPS-inoculated mice similar to that observed in control mice. SIGNIFICANCE: This study shows that the Catwalk gait analysis system can be used to objectively quantify LPS-induced monoarthritis weight bearing changes in all four limbs and evaluate pharmacological antinociception in freely moving mice.},

	abstract = {Locomotion results from an interplay between biomechanical constraints of the muscles attached to the skeleton and the neuronal circuits controlling and coordinating muscle activities. Quadrupeds exhibit a wide range of locomotor gaits. Given our advances in the genetic identification of spinal and supraspinal circuits important to locomotion in the mouse, it is now important to get a better understanding of the full repertoire of gaits in the freely walking mouse. To assess this range, young adult C57BL/6J mice were trained to walk and run on a treadmill at different locomotor speeds. Instead of using the classical paradigm defining gaits according to their footfall pattern, we combined the inter-limb coupling and the duty cycle of the stance phase, thus identifying several types of gaits: lateral walk, trot, out-of-phase walk, rotary gallop, transverse gallop, hop, half-bound, and full-bound. Out-of-phase walk, trot, and full-bound were robust and appeared to function as attractor gaits (i.e., a state to which the network flows and stabilizes) at low, intermediate, and high speeds respectively. In contrast, lateral walk, hop, transverse gallop, rotary gallop, and half-bound were more transient and therefore considered transitional gaits (i.e., a labile state of the network from which it flows to the attractor state). Surprisingly, lateral walk was less frequently observed. Using graph analysis, we demonstrated that transitions between gaits were predictable, not random. In summary, the wild-type mouse exhibits a wider repertoire of locomotor gaits than expected. Future locomotor studies should benefit from this paradigm in assessing transgenic mice or wild-type mice with neurotraumatic injury or neurodegenerative disease affecting gait.},

The software was able to recognize the pixels constituting the image and extract the following parameters: distance traveled, average speed, average potency, time immobile, number of stops, time spent in different areas of the field and time immobile/number of stops. All data were exported for further analysis. The system was able to effectively extract the desired parameters. Thus, it was possible to observe developmental changes in the patterns of movement of the animals. We also discuss similarities and differences between this system and previously described systems. {\textbackslash}copyright 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Stroke is one of the common causes of death and disability. Despite extensive efforts in stroke research, therapeutic options for improving the functional recovery remain limited in clinical practice. Experimental stroke models using genetically modified mice could aid in unraveling the complex pathophysiology triggered by ischemic brain injury. Here, we optimized the procedure for generating mouse stroke model using an intraluminal suture in the middle cerebral artery and verified the blockage of blood flow using indocyanine green coupled with near infra-red radiation. The first week after the ischemic injury was critical for survivability. The survival rate of 11\% in mice without any treatment but increased to 60\% on administering prophylactic antibiotics. During this period, mice showed severe functional impairment but recovered spontaneously starting from the second week onward. Among the various behavioral tests, the pole tests and neurological severity score tests remained reliable up to 4 weeks after ischemia, whereas the rotarod and corner tests became less sensitive for assessing the severity of ischemic injury with time. Further, loss of body weight was also observed for up 4 weeks after ischemia induction. In conclusion, we have developed an improved approach which allows us to investigate the role of the cell death-related genes in the disease progression using genetically modified mice and to evaluate the modes of action of candidate drugs.},

	abstract = {Automated tracking offers a number of advantages over both manual and photocell tracking methodologies, including increased reliability, validity, and flexibility of application. Despite the advantages that video offers, our experience has been that video systems cannot track a mouse consistently when its coat color is in low contrast with the background. Furthermore, the local lab lighting can influence how well results are quantified. To test the effect of lighting, we built devices that provide a known path length for any given trial duration, at a velocity close to the average speed of a mouse in the open-field and the circular water maze. We found that the validity of results from two commercial video tracking systems (ANY-maze and EthoVision XT) depends greatly on the level of contrast and the quality of the lighting. A photocell detection system was immune to lighting problems but yielded a path length that deviated from the true length. Excellent precision was achieved consistently, however, with video tracking using infrared backlighting in both the open field and water maze. A high correlation (r=0.98) between the two software systems was observed when infrared backlighting was used with live mice. Copyright 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The Open Field (OF) test is one of the most commonly used assays for assessing exploratory behaviour and generalised locomotor activity in rodents. Nevertheless, the vast majority of researchers still rely upon costly commercial systems for recording and analysing OF test results. Consequently, our aim was to design a freely available program for analysing the OF test and to provide an accompanying protocol that was minimally invasive, rapid, unbiased, without the need for specialised equipment or training. Similar to commercial systems, we show that our software-called MouseMove-accurately quantifies numerous parameters of movement including travel distance, speed, turning and curvature. To assess its utility, we used MouseMove to quantify unilateral locomotor deficits in mice following the filament-induced middle cerebral artery occlusion model of acute ischemic stroke. MouseMove can also monitor movement within defined regions-of-interest and is therefore suitable for analysing the Novel Object Recognition test and other field-related cognitive tests. To the best of our knowledge, MouseMove is the first open source software capable of providing qualitative and quantitative information on mouse locomotion in a semi-automated and high-throughput fashion, and hence MouseMove represents a sound alternative to commercial movement analysis systems.},
